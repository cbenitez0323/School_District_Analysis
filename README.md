# School_District_Analysis

## Overview of the school district analysis: 
The purpose of the analysis was to observe the changes to the school's reading and math score after removing the score of Thomas High School's ninth graders. Therefore the analysis consists of altering the data and running a summary analysis consisting of determining the average score, the passing scores, and the overall passing grades of Thomas High School and then comparing it to the other schools.  

## Results: 

- The district summary shows the average math and reading scores and the passing percentage oof the scores. After removing the scores of the ninth graders from Thomas High School, the district summary scores went slightly down but not enough to provide a huge impact.

- The school summary goes into more detail compared to the district summary by showing the same information but by each school. Thomas High School scores did change slightly.

- The first image is the performance of the school to the previous analysis versus the second image is the top school performance after removing the ninth grade scores. The removal of the scores did not affect the school's ranking in comparison to the top schools. Therefore you can conclude that although we removed a grade from the high school it did not impact the analysis and was able to give a fairly accurate representation of the school's performance.

-The math and reading scores by grade summary for each school was affected by removing the ninth grade scores bebause there is now missing information but it did not affect the other grade's scores from Thomas High School. The only possible challenge is not being able to directly compare the ninth grades performance to the other schools of the district.

- The summary based on school spending per student shows no changes after excluding the ninth graders. This is likely due to the fact that when doing the analysis we still used the total school population when determining how much the school spends per student.

- The summary based on school size did not change after removing the ninth graders. This is ideal as the lack of scores should not interfere with the numbers concerning other aspects of the school like budget, sizing, or school type

- There weren't any changes to the summary based on school type. The numbers stayed consistent and it was likely due to the fact that the difference in removing the ninth graders didnt make a big impact in the averages. On top of that, the numbers were rounded to the nearest whole and therefore it was be harder to notice any smaller changes.
